Web Scraping to Create a Dataset using Python

Web Scraping is one of the skills that every data science professional should know.

Sometimes the data we need is available on a website in the form of a table that cannot be downloaded directly.

We may collect data directly from the website using web scraping techniques.

There are so many libraries, frameworks, and tools that are used for the task of web scraping.

Some of the most common libraries and modules in Python used for web scraping are:

* Scrapy
* Selenium
* BeautifulSoup
* urlib.request

All of the above Python libraries and modules are great for scraping data from websites.

After scraping the data, the data is prepared so that it can be stored in a CSV file to create a dataset.
